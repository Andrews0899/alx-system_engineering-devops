 Loops, conditions and parsing

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
How to create SSH keys
What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
How to use while, until and for loops
How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
How to use the cut command
What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
You are not allowed to use awk
Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing


Shellcheck
Shellcheck is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. Shellcheck is your friend! All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error or you will not get any points on the task.

Shellcheck is available on the school’s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to install it.

TASKS 
Create a SSH RSA key pair


man: ssh-keygen

You will soon have to manage your own servers concept page hosted on remote data centers. We need to set them up with your RSA public key so that you can access them via SSH.

Create a RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Share your public key in your answer file 0-RSA_public_key.pub
Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the public key you just generated
Keep the private key to yourself in a secure location, you will use it later to connect to your servers using SSH. Some storing ideas are Dropbox, Google Drive, password manager, USB key. Failing to do so will prevent you to access your servers, which will prevent you from doing your projects
If you decide to add a passphrase to your key, make sure to save this passphrase in a secure location, you will not be able to use your keys without the passphrase
SSH and RSA keys will be covered in depth in a later project
